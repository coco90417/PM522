# Clinical trial design final project
The study of the outcome of patients treated for newly-diagnosed advanced stage hepatobastoma (a form of childhood liver cancer) has been completed, and the clinical investigator consider to add a fourth drug, Adriamycin, to the current three chemotherapy drugs: Cisplatin, 5-FU and vincristine. There were improvements been observed in the current treatment, but the advanced-stage patients have been reported to be another risk factor to the analytic event.
The purpose of this project is to design, conduct and analyze a clinical trial to determine if the addition of the fourth drug results in a reduction in the adverse event rate.
